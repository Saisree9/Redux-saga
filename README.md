I want to compare redux-thunk and redux-saga

In this my first commit is with redux-thunk

and in the second commit i replaced it with the redux-saga

You can just checkout to these commits and compare both redux-thunk and redux-saga

I took reference code from the [blog](https://hackernoon.com/moving-form-redux-thunk-to-redux-saga-5c19d0011ca0)
